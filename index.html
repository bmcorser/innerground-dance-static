          <h1>About Inner Ground Dance Company</h1>
          <p>
            Inner Ground Dance Company is Cornwall's contemporary dance company
            for people who are over 50.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Company is led by two Artistic Directors, Jayne Devlin and
            Caroline Schanche. Jayne and Caroline take classes and workshops
            for members, choreograph our performance pieces, and lead the
            development of the Company.
          </p>
            The company is a constituted community organisation.

          <h1>What Inner Ground Dance Company have done ...</h1>
          <h2>
            Setting up the Company
          </h2>
          <p>
            In 2012, Jayne Devlin and Caroline Schanche identified a demand for
            high quality dance classes, workshops and performances for mature
            dancers in Cornwall. They held in that year two callout workshops
            for Inner Ground Dance Company, which were advertised through the
            local press in Cornwall, and the Internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            These workshops introduced potential company members to the
            Artistic Directors, provided time to experience their working style
            and time to consider whether to join the company. The only criteria
            for joining were to be: aged over 50. and to commit to attending
            all the rehearsals. (It was understood that occasionally something
            might occur that would prevent attendance but the principal was
            established that members could not drop in and out of sessions as
            it suited them and that this commitment would underpin the high
            quality of the work.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Of the 20 people who attended those workshops, nine people (all
            women) joined Inner Ground Dance Company, and Arts for Health
            Cornwall’s project ‘Moving Forward Looking Back’ provided the
            platform to launch the company. The company currently has around 15
            members, both women and men.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Three New Dance Pieces
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>2013 – I am Myself Again</li>
            <li>2015 – Line Trace Time</li>
            <li>2015 – The Table</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In 2013, “Moving Forward Looking Back” (MoFoLoBa) won the Arts and
            Heath SW award in the Health category for its innovative approaches
            to health and well-being provision (Caroline was the project lead
            for the overall project).  Inner Ground had been formed partly to
            provide a legacy for the project (along with the Visual Arts and
            Creative Writing elements of MoFoLoBa).
          </p>
          <p>
            Through a year-long development with regular workshops, Inner
            Ground created their first performance piece – I am Myself Again –
            choreographed by Jayne Devlin. This was performed in 2013 as part
            of MoFoLoBa, at The Exchange Penzance; at Bristol City Hall for the
            AHSW award ceremony, and at Dartington Hall, for “Dance in Time”
            (UN Day of the Older Person).
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2015 the second piece (choreographed by Caroline) Line Trace
            Time, was performed at Sterts Arts and Community Centre (Liskeard)
            as part of the Midsummer Dance Festival, at Tremenheere Sculpture
            Garden in Penzance, and at Dartington Hall (Dance in Time, 2015).
            Line Trace Time, and The Table (the third piece, choreographed by
            Jayne Devlin) were performed at AMATA (Falmouth University) as part
            of Mergecology in December 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the 3 years since Inner Ground's creation, the company has
            hosted workshops run by Yael Flexer, Panta Rei, Helen Parlor Dance,
            NDT2, Emily Dobson and Rambert Dance Co. Each of these workshops
            had around 20 participants.

            Rambert Dance Company

          <p>
            The company has been offered the possibility of working with
            Rambert Dance Company in 2016 and 2017, leading to a performance at
            the Hall for Cornwall in Spring 2017, and for this project there is
            the need to extend the reach of the company to a wider membership,
            probably over a wider part of Cornwall. There will also be a
            funding bid to the Arts Council early in 2016.

              Jayne graduated from De Montfort University in 1994 and has 18
              years experience working as a community dance artist as well as
              facilitating and participating in choreographic and performance
              projects. In addition to her work with Inner Ground Dance Company
              Jayne has received choreographic commissions from The Works Dance
              and Theatre Cornwall, Cscape Dance Company and Dance South West.
              These include a site specific piece for inclusion in, “The Venus
              Flower” 2011 and 2013, “Ocean Stars” and Pulse FX, and for the
              Olympiad Launch in Bodmin in 2009.
            <p>
            </p>
              Her most recent commission was for the Arts for Health Cornwall
              ‘Home Service’ project, about which Phil Gibby, Area Director,
              South West, Arts Council England, said: 'This project is a great
              example of the impact of arts and culture on the wellbeing of
              individuals and its capacity for nurturing a sense of community.”
              This project was also mentioned in an article in the Guardian.

              Jayne provides vibrant inclusive dance sessions for the regional
              Memory Cafes and specialist residential and day care providers
              for older people. She is dedicated to raising the profile and

              Caroline trained in theatre at Dartington College of Arts
              (81-85).  This course was grounded in the philosophy that the
              arts should be embedded in community life and available to all.
              She specialised in dance improvisation and Anatomical Release
              Technique under Mary Faulkerson’s internationally renowned
              leadership of the dance department.
            </p>
            <p>
              After graduating she began working in London with marginalised
              groups such as adults with learning disabilities and elderly
              visually impaired people. Inspired by the positive impact of
              dance and movement with these groups she trained as a dance
              movement therapist at Hertfordshire College of Art and Design.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the last 24 years she has lived and worked in West Cornwall
              running sessions for groups of all ages and abilities including
              pre-school children, medical students, stroke patients, people
              with learning disabilities and dementia.
