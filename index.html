          <h2>Organisational Credentials</h2>
          </p>
            Inner Ground Dance Company was formed as part of the larger Arts
            for Health Cornwall &amp; the Isles of Scilly project entitled
            “Moving Forward Looking Back”.  This was an award winning project
            within the Health category of Arts &amp; Health South West due to
            its innovative approaches to health and wellbeing provision. Follow
            <a href="http://www.artsforhealthcornwall.org.uk/projects/celebrating-age-and-ambition">this link</a>
            for a short film about this project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arts for Health Cornwall’s project <em>Moving Forward Looking
              Back</em> consolidated both Jayne’s and Caroline’s working
            practices and to them clearly identified a demand for high quality
            dance classes, workshops and performances for mature dancers in
            Cornwall, and in 2012 formed Inner Ground Dance Company to meet
            this demand.  Arts for Health Cornwall’s project ‘Moving Forward
            Looking Back’ provided the platform to launch the company.

          <h1>Our Work</h1>
          <p>
            Since the launch of Inner Ground Dance Company in 2013 our dancers
            have participated in workshops with: Rambert Dance Company, Yael
            Flexer, Panta Rei Danseteatre, Helen Parlor Dance, NDT2, Emily
            Dobson (Freefall Dance) and Joli Yyann, along with expertly
            delivered company classes with Jayne and Caroline. These workshops
            were hosted through regional partnership building with HfC, Carn to
            Cove, AMATA (Falmouth University) and Tremenheere Sculpture Garden.
          </p>
          <p>
            Workshops have also worked in conjunction with our extended
            regional mature dancers network which is for anyone who has
            expressed an interest in Inner Ground’s vision of a fresh and
            inclusive approach to dance for the mature dancer, at any stage in
            their development.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the summer of 2015 Inner Ground were in residency at AMATA
            (Falmouth University).

            “I have been laid, rubbed clean, soiled and unsoiled…
            <br />

          <p>
            The Table is Inner Ground’s most recent dance-theatre project,
            choreographed by Jayne Devlin. The piece delves into the minds,
            lives, relationships and emotions of a group of people that are
            summoned to gather around a very old, worn out and inherited
            family table. Work in progress was shared at the SpinDrift Dance
            Mergecology event at AMATA (Falmouth University).

          <p>
            ‘Line Trace Time’ is an interdisciplinary performance project,
            choreographed by Caroline Schanche.
          </p>
          <p>
            Underlying the choreography are the questions, what do we bring
            to different spaces and locations? What are the traces we leave
            behind? How quickly do they disappear?
          </p>
          <p>
            The structure of the performance is based around seven different
            constructivist sculptures by Naum Gabo, reinterpreted as movement
            scores. Just as sculpture is placed in, and framed by, different
            contexts, we place and frame these scores in different
            landscapes, exploring the interplay between the human figure,
            movement and context. How do figures in a landscape change the
            environment?  How do different environments change the
            performers’ engagement with the movement scores? How does
            performance in the landscape engage audiences and change their
            experience of that place? What do we bring inside when performing
            in a theatre?
          </p>
          <p>
            'Line Trace Time' has been performed at Tremenheere Sculpture
            Garden, Sterts Theatre Midsummer Dance Festival and SpinDrift
            Dance Mergecology at AMATA (Falmouth University).

            Inner Ground created their first performance piece <em>I Am
            Myself Again</em>, choreographed by Jayne Devlin, during a year
            of regular workshops and classes.  The piece was performed at:
            Exchange Gallery, Penzance; Bristol City Hall (Arts
            & Health South West Award Ceremony) and Dartington Hall (“Dance
            in Time” UN Day of the Older Person).

            Caroline trained in theatre at Dartington College of Arts (81-85).
            This course was grounded in the philosophy that the arts should be
            embedded in community life and available to all.  She specialised
            in dance improvisation and Anatomical Release Technique under Mary
            Faulkerson’s internationally renowned leadership of the dance
            department.
          </p>
          <p>
            After graduating she began working in London with marginalised
            groups such as adults with learning disabilities and elderly
            visually impaired people. Inspired by the positive impact of dance
            and movement with these groups she trained as a dance movement
            therapist at Hertfordshire College of Art and Design.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the last 24 years she has lived and worked in West Cornwall
            running sessions for groups of all ages and abilities including
            pre-school children, medical students, stroke patients, people with
            learning disabilities and dementia.
