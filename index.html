            Setting up the Company
          </h2>
          <p>
            In 2012, Jayne Devlin and Caroline Schanche identified a demand for high
            quality dance classes, workshops and performances for mature dancers in
            Cornwall. They held in that year two callout workshops for Inner Ground
            Dance Company, which were advertised through the local press in Cornwall,
            and the Internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            These workshops introduced potential company members to the Artistic
            Directors, provided time to experience their working style and time to
            consider whether to join the company. The only criteria for joining were
            to be: aged over 50. and to commit to attending all the rehearsals. (It
            was understood that occasionally something might occur that would prevent
            attendance but the principal was established that members could not drop
            in and out of sessions as it suited them and that this commitment would
            underpin the high quality of the work.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Of the 20 people who attended those workshops, nine people (all women)
            joined Inner Ground Dance Company, and Arts for Health Cornwall’s project
            ‘Moving Forward Looking Back’ provided the platform to launch the
            company. The company currently has around 15 members, both women and men.
          </p>

            Three New Dance Pieces
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>2013 – I am Myself Again</li>
            <li>2015 – Line Trace Time</li>
            <li>2015 – The Table</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In 2013, “Moving Forward Looking Back” (MoFoLoBa) won the Arts and Heath
            SW award in the Health category for its innovative approaches to health
            and well-being provision(Carolinewastheprojectleadfortheoverallproject).
            InnerGroundhad been formed partly to provide a legacy for the project
            (along with the Visual Arts and Creative Writing elements of MoFoLoBa).
          </p>
          <p>
            Through a year-long development with regular workshops, Inner Ground
            created their first performance piece – I am Myself Again – choreographed
            by Jayne Devlin. This was performed in 2013 as part of MoFoLoBa, at The
            Exchange Penzance; at Bristol City Hall for the AHSW award ceremony, and
            at Dartington Hall, for “Dance in Time” (UN Day of the Older Person).
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2015 the second piece (choreographed by Caroline) Line Trace Time, was
            performed at Sterts Arts and Community Centre (Liskeard) as part of the
            Midsummer Dance Festival, at Tremenheere Sculpture Garden in Penzance,
            and at Dartington Hall (Dance in Time, 2015). Line Trace Time, and The
            Table (the third piece, choreographed by Jayne Devlin) were performed at
            AMATA (Falmouth University) as part of Mergecology in December 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the 3 years since Inner Ground's creation, the company has hosted
            workshops run by Yael Flexer, Panta Rei, Helen Parlor Dance, NDT2, Emily
            Dobson and Rambert Dance Co. Each of these workshops had around 20
            participants.

            The company has been offered the possibility of working with
            Rambert Dance Company in 2016 and 2017, leading to a performance at
            the Hall for Cornwall in Spring 2017, and for this project there is
            the need to extend the reach of the company to a wider membership,
            probably over a wider part of Cornwall. There will also be a
            funding bid to the Arts Council early in 2016.
