          <h1>Our Work</h1>
          <p>
            Since the launch of Inner Ground Dance Company in 2013 our dancers
            have participated in workshops with; Rambert Dance Company, Yael
            Flexer, Panta Rei Danseteatre, Helen Parlor Dance, NDT2, Emily
            Dobson (Freefall Dance) and Joli Yyann, along with expertly
            delivered Company Class with Jayne and Caroline.  These workshops
            were hosted through regional partnership building with Hfc, Carn to
            Cove, AMATA (Falmouth University) and Tremenheere Sculpture Garden.
          </p>
          <p>
            Workshops have also worked in conjunction with our extended
            regional Mature Dancers Network which is for anyone who has
            expressed an interest in Inner Ground’s vision of a fresh and
            inclusive approach to dance for the mature dancer, at any stage in
            their development.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the summer of 2015 Inner Ground were in residency at AMATA
            (Falmouth University).

            </p>
            <p>
              The Table is Inner Ground’s most recent Dance Theatre project.
              Choreographed by Jayne Devlin and dancers it explores themes and
              ideas that delve into the minds, lives, relationships and
              emotions of a group of people that are summoned to gather around
              a very old, worn out and inherited family table.  Work in
              progress was shared at SpinDrift Dance Mergecology event at AMATA
              (Falmouth University).

            <h2>Line Trace Time (2014)</h2>
            <p>
              ‘Line Trace Time’ is an interdisciplinary performance project,
              choreographed by Caroline Schanche. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Underlying the choreography are the questions, what do we bring
              to different spaces and locations? What are the traces we leave
              behind? How quickly do they disappear?
            </p>
            <p>
              The structure of the performance is based around 7 different
              constructivist sculptures by Naum Gabo reinterpreted as movement
              scores. Just as sculpture is placed in, and framed by, different
              contexts, we place and frame these scores in different landscapes
              exploring the interplay between the human figure, movement and
              context. How do figures in a landscape change the environment?
              How do different environments change the performers’ engagement
              with the movement scores? How does performance in the landscape
              engage audiences and change their experience of that place? What
              do we bring inside when performing in a theatre?
            </p>
            <p>
              'Line Trace Time' has been performed at Tremenheere Sculpture
              Garden, Sterts Theatre Midsummer Dance Festival and SpinDrift
              Dance Mergecology event at AMATA (Falmouth University).

            <p class="passage">
              “Balancing on stone – skimming soft flat round such stone –
              fitting for purpose – fitting small hands – bending, legs apart,
              to flatten the stone’s surface to parallel the sea surface
              before letting fly.
              <br />
              To a cave of bones, calm bones tin stones
              <br />
              Full of memory, family, blood ties
              <br />
              To the place of the ancestors
              <br />
              To the place where I must finally return”
            </p>
            <p>
              Through a year-long development with regular workshops and class,
              Inner Ground created their first performance piece – I am myself
              again – choreographed by Jayne Devlin.  This was performed at
              the; Exchange Gallery, Penzance, Bristol City Hall for the Arts &
              Health South West Award Ceremony, and at Dartington Hall for
              “Dance in Time” (UN Day of the Older Person).
            </p>
              Moving Forward Looking Back consolidated both Jayne’s and
              Caroline’s working practices and to them clearly identified a
              demand for high quality dance classes, workshops and performances
              for mature dancers in Cornwall, and in 2012 formed Inner Ground
              Dance Company to meet this demand.  Arts for Health Cornwall’s
              project ‘Moving Forward Looking Back’ provided the platform to
              launch the company. 
            <p>
              Inner Ground Dance Company was formed as part of the above
              mentioned larger Arts for Health Cornwall & the Isles of Scilly
              project entitled “Moving Forward Looking Back”.  This was an
              award winning project within the Health category of Arts & Health
              South West due to its innovative approaches to health and
              wellbeing provision. Follow

              Caroline trained in theatre at Dartington College of Arts
              (81-85).  This course was grounded in the philosophy that the
              arts should be embedded in community life and available to all.
              She specialised in dance improvisation and Anatomical Release
              Technique under Mary Faulkerson’s internationally renowned
              leadership of the dance department.
            </p>
            <p>
              After graduating she began working in London with marginalised
              groups such as adults with learning disabilities and elderly
              visually impaired people. Inspired by the positive impact of
              dance and movement with these groups she trained as a dance
              movement therapist at Hertfordshire College of Art and Design.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the last 24 years she has lived and worked in West Cornwall
              running sessions for groups of all ages and abilities including
              pre-school children, medical students, stroke patients, people
              with learning disabilities and dementia.
